* AKellermann's emacs repo (and other old files)

[[./emacs.png]]

This is the landing spot for my personal emacs configuration. Used for easy updating across computers. However, this emacs configuration has many issues that may arise if you try to put this on your own system.

** Potential Pitfalls
- Lack of proper fonts. You need San Fransico on your system. If you don't remove that line.
- Lack of proper packages. The 'Eglot' Language Server package isn't on Melpa yet, you need to manually install it or remove it from the system.
- Not emacs 26, you need emacs 26 or greater.
- There are lots of custom keybindings. If you're using this to learn emacs, remove those keybindings.
