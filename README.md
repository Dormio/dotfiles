#Dormio's .vimrc & NEW init.vim
I started using vim in May of 2015. I didn't put much effort into it until early December 2015 when I started writing some C code in it. Here is that vimrc.

##Features of the vimrc 

- Automatic Installation of the Vim-Plug plugin manager
- Automatic Configuration of the GUI font
- Gruvbox colorscheme pre-installed
- Most features should be up and running
- Custom tailored for MacVim (This version isn't designed for terminal usage)
- Syntax turned on
- Tabs converted into spaces
- Nerd Tree shortcut of F2 to enable.

##Differences between init.vim and .vimrc
- Difference plug in locations
- Tabs were correctly updated for the init.vim and not for the .vimrc
- different auto complete plug-in that takes advantage of neovim's new powers
- init.vim is the one used for my personal PC
##Potential Problems

- Never been tested on Linux or Windows based Systems.
- GUI font may cause trouble if run inside the terminal.
- Colorscheme will look weird on Terminals that can only display 256 colors.

###Important Note

The vimrc is only here in case I need it, or for reference for anyone else who is looking into implementing a similar vimrc for their own personal use. In my personal opinion, there is no reason if a person is deciding to use vim not to use neovim. Instructions can be found on the [neovim website](http://neovim.io)
