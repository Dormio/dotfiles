##Dormio's .vimrc
I started using vim in May of 2015. I didn't put much effort into it until early December 2015 when I started writing some C code in it. Here is that vimrc.

#Features of the vimrc 

- Automatic Installation of the Vim-Plug plugin manager
- Automatic Configuration of the GUI font
- Gruvbox colorscheme pre-installed
- Most features should be up and running
- Custom tailored for MacVim (This version isn't designed for terminal usage)
- Syntax turned on
- Tabs converted into spaces
- Nerd Tree shortcut of F2 to enable.

#Potential Problems

- Never been tested on Linux or Windows based Systems.
- GUI font may cause trouble if run inside the terminal.
- Colorscheme will look weird on Terminals that can only display 256 colors.
