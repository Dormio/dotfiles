#Dormio's dotfiles
Here are some of the dotfiles I use for various programs. Right now you can find dotfiles for
- i3 (Window Manager)
- Neovim and Vim (Text Editors)
- i3 blocks (status_command for i3)

### Dependencies for i3
- I use rofi as a replacement for demenu, it's a personal preference, as they both operate almost exactly the same.
- I use py3status instead of i3status for the moment, although that might change in the future

## Dependencies for Nvim/vim
- Vim Plug (needs to be installed for the rest of the file to work. Once installed everything else should operate as expected.)

####Some notes
These files haven't been tested on a variety of machines, so you may find that some things do not work
straight out of the box.
